# kmeans-clustering
Python implementation of Kmeans clustering for unsupervised learning. Features random initialization of centers, testing on 2D data (K=2 and K=3), and clustering of the MNIST dataset with means for K=5, 10, and 15. Includes code documentation and visualizations.

2D_data.txt is an X and Y value data set used for unclustered and clustered K data plots.

testX.txt, testY.txt, trainX.txt, and trainY.txt are data sets for Kmeans clustering testing.
